### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Hello, I'm Pius, a software engineer hailing from Nairobi, Kenya. I've embarked on a dynamic journey in the world of technology as a full-stack developer, honing my skills to become technically multilingual in the digital realm. Proficient in a range of programming languages and tools, I navigate seamlessly through the likes of React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Node.js, Bootstrap, SQL, and Flask. In addition to my software expertise, I double as a cybersecurity consultant, proficient in using tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, and OWASP, ensuring that the digital landscapes I touch remain secure. With a flair for wit and a penchant for smart solutions, I'm here to contribute to the ever-evolving tech universe.
